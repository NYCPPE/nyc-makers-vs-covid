# NYC Makes PPE

NYC Makes PPE is a group of makers and healthcare professionals in NYC leveraging DIY manufacturing technology to support PPE production in NYC and worldwide. This website seeks to consolidate information gathered during planning and manufacturing for reference.

## Fundraising

We are running a gofundme campaign to cover material costs for all manufactured PPE donated to hospitals. They campaign is being organized by Hack Manhattan, a 501(c)(3) exempt charity. Any surplus we cannot reasonably use will be donated to other COVID-19 relief efforts or relevant 501(c)(3) exempt charities not part of this campaign. Thank you for your financial support.
