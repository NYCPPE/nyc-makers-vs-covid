These designs can be used to make complete PPE ‘Face-shields’† using only thin plastic materials and some folding. NO NEED FOR ANY OTHER MATERIALS OR ASSEMBLY. We have developed a range of designs that we believe will work for different materials and cutting methods, depending on what you have available.

Please perform your own testing, validation and sterilization protocols before use.
