# Fabric Masks and Respirators

We don't recommend 3D-printing masks and respirators. This [blog post by Prusa](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/from-design-to-mass-3d-printing-of-medical-shields-in-three-days/) explains it well.

However, sewn masks can be worn individually or over N95 masks for added protection. We list available designs below. These masks are not meant to be replacement for surgical or medical grade equipment.

## Sewn 100% Cotton Masks

[[success]]
| **This is currently our preferred mask making protocol and patterns. Along with the info sheet for healthcare workers.**

| ![](/img/mask.jpg) | These masks were produced based on advice from Open-Source COVID19 Medical Supplies. They are made of 2 layers of 100% cotton fabric. The masks have been stitched together using [insert your thread type here] thread. <br/> <br/> These masks are intended to be worn over existing PPE to prolong the life of surgical masks or N95 masks. These masks should be washed before use. They are suitable for use in contaminated environments but are not sterile. Do not touch the side that goes against your face. |

Currently in production by our friends at Skilled Laborers Brigade, NYC Face Mask Initiative, and at-home sewers in NYC.

### Turban Project Fabric Mask

This is a sewn mask pattern, available via Deaconess Hospital. Instructions and patterns are available here: [\[external link\]](https://www.deaconess.com/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask)

### A.B. Mask

This design was vetted with the Skilled Laborers Brigade and is being manufactured in NYC. Instructions are available here: [\[External Link\]](https://www.instructables.com/id/AB-Mask-for-a-Nurse-by-a-Nurse/)

## Operation We Can Sew It

This sewn mask project started to connect volunteers with Denver’s SCL Health System and Saint Joseph Hospital to protect medical workers during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic. Instructions and patterns are available here: [\[external link\]](https://operationwecansewit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/We-Can-Sew-It-Mask-Pattern-2.20.20-v4.pdf)

## Alternative Designs:

<!-- ### Olson Fabric Mask

Surgical masks can be sewn, according to [UnityPoint Health hospital in Cedar Rapids](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:tbxilmN4LPcJ:https://www.unitypoint.org/cedarrapids/sewing-surgical-masks.aspx+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us). The Olson Mask pattern is available here: [\[Internal Link\]](/pdf/OlsonMask_wPattern_v3.pdf)

> UnityPoint Health – Cedar Rapids has an adequate supply of masks however – they remain in short supply nationwide due to COVID-19. The hospital is looking to be proactive in addressing the possibility of future supply challenges. Therefore, St. Luke's is calling all sewers to help make masks. Our hope is that we won't need them, but we must plan for the unknown.
>
> Fabric masks offer the benefit of being able to be washed and re-used as each healthcare worker will need to change their mask several times during their shifts, as the mask becomes soiled or damp – for maximum protection.

### DIY Paper Mask

[[warning]]
| This design has not yet been tested - please [reach out](mailto:nycmakesppe@gmail.com) if you're interested in giving feeback.

This mask concept can be assembled in about 10 minutes using a piece paper. Designed for the general public to avoid using supply that might be needed by hospitals or those who can't otherwise get access to other masks. Instructions are available here: [\[Internal Link\]](/pdf/Face_Mask_DIY_V2.4_JP_Leconte_PaperPaul.pdf)

# Face Shields

Face shields are worn by doctors and nurses when intubating patients to prevent fluids from contacting their face. They are often worn on top of N95 masks, and protects both the user and the mask. Face shields can be manufactured easily with 3D printing, laser cutting plastic sheets, or potentially die-cutting plastic sheets.

### 3DVerkstan Face Shield

[[success]]
| **This is currently our preferred 3DP design.**

| ![](/img/verkstan.jpg) | It uses a glasses-like design, and does not require foam or elastic parts. It is designed for plastic from a sheet protector, with holes punched with a standard hole puncher. |

### WISC

| ![](/img/wisc.jpg) | This is a face shield manufactured from a plastic sheet, foam tape, and elastic. This design takes far less time to manufacture, but is disposable due to the unsanitizable foam. |

### Open Source Face Shield

| ![](/img/nyu.png) | This is a face shield design by the NYU COVID-19 Task Force. It is manufactured from a plastic sheet and elastic. A well-placed plastic forehead piece prevents the need for a foam spacer. |

### Prusa RC2

| ![](/img/prusa.jpg) | Designed by [Prusa Research](https://www.prusa3d.com/), this design involves 3D printed parts, a laser cut face shield, and an elastic backing. |

Companies are also printing and selling this design.

- Shapeways is selling just the 3DP parts for \$40 [\[external link\]](https://business.shapeways.com/covid19)
- Voodoo Manufacturing will be selling the completed shield for \$10 at bulk [\[external link\]](https://combatingcovid.com/)

While this may be the most durable design, the output may be too slow to meet the demand in NYC. It takes about 2~3 hours to print each headband part, which is too slow.

### Budmen

| ![](/img/budmen.jpeg) | This is also a 3D printed design by Budmen Industries. Requesting or manufacturing the design requires registration. [\[external link\]](https://budmen.com/) |

# Logistics & Legal

When manufacturing PPE, follow these instructions recommended by Prusa Research:

- **Act as if you were infected by the COVID-19 virus.** Wear a **face mask** and a **fresh pair of gloves** when collecting each batch of printed parts. Store the parts immediately in a sealable bag.
- Talk with whoever you’re making the shields for, let them know about your manufacturing environment.
- There is still debate about how long the virus survives on plastic, but most sources mention 2-3 days. That means that by letting the packed face shields sit for 2-3 days before distributing them, you’ll greatly reduce risk of transmission.
- **Do not store the entire stock in one place**, minimize the risk of cross-contamination.

|One of our members have written a legal disclaimer (with lawyer consultation) to include with face shield donations to hospitals. It is available [here:](/pdf/Face_Shield_Disclaimer.pdf). If you are selling such face shields, you may want to acquire your own legal counsel.
